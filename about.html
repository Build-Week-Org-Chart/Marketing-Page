      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You have to make these big decisions. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Imagination is the key to painting. It's important to me that you're happy. In your world you have total and absolute power.</p>

          <p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
